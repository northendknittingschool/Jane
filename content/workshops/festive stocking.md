This one day workshop is suitable for beginners with experience of other crafts requiring dexterity, as parts of the process are fiddly!

This is a lovely workshop to do with friends to get you in the Christmas spirit!

You choose the yarns for your stocking from a small range of merino wool colours and the Fairisle pattern . Then you will learn the basics of machine knitting, so that you can create your very own Christmas stocking.

I will supply tea and coffee (or you choice of drink) and mince pies, but ask that you bring a packed lunch.

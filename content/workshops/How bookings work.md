Please contact Jane at northendknittingschool@gmail.com to start the process

of booking your workshop.

The workshops tend to be run on Sundays, however I can be flexible and work around my work commitments at NTU.

Where the cost of a workshop is based on a minimum of 2 people, I will plan a date with you, and then promote the workshop on this website and Social Media to attract a second person.

Where the cost is based on a group booking, you will need to book with either 1 or 2 friends to get the deal!

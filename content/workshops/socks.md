Come and make a lovely pair of slouchy slipper socks.

suitable for beginners with some experience of machine knitting.

Skills involved:

\-Turned up hem

\-punch card knitting or stripes

\-partial knitting (turning a heel)

\-binding off

In the morning you will choose your yarn and decide between Fairisle or stripy socks.

After morning break you will start knitting the socks and continue after lunch.

I will supply tea and coffee (or your choice of drink) but ask that you bring a packed lunch.

You decide what you want to learn and I will tailor the workshop to your needs.

If you have invested in a new machine, why not bring it along and we can check it all works ok and then make sure you have the skills to get started when you're back at home.

If you'd prefer not to bring a machine with you, I have Knitmaster and Brother punch card machines with ribbing attachments plus a chunky Brother, also with ribbing attachment.

I also have a Passap Duomatic and an electronic Silverreed SK840, which I use with DesignaKnit.

Maybe you have an idea for a garment but don't know where to start? In a 1-2-1 we could work out the knit calculations and sample any tricky parts, such as neck openings, neck trim or pockets. You can take home a bespoke knitting pattern along with the skills needed to knit your design.

I will supply tea & coffee (or your drink of choice!) but ask that you bring a packed lunch with you.

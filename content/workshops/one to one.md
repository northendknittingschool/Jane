You decide want to want to learn and I will tailor the workshop to your needs.

If you have invested in a new machine, why not bring it along and we can check it all works ok and then make sure you have the skills to get started when you're back at home.

If you'd prefer not to bring a machine with you, I have Knitmaster and Brother punch card machines with ribbing attachments plus a chunky Brother, also with ribbing attachment.

I will supply tea & coffee (or your drink of choice!) but ask that you bring a packed lunch with you.

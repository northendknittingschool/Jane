This workshop is suitable for those who want to get more out of their ribber attachment.

during the day we will create samples of various double bed fabrics; 1x1, 2x1, 2x2, wide ribs, English rib, fisherman’s rib, ripples and long stitch.

we will also  create some racked and plated fabrics.

most importantly though, you will leave understanding what all the buttons and levers do on your machine, so that you can be in charge of your machine!

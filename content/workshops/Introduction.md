Whether you already knit and want to try machine knitting or just enjoy being creative and crafty, this is the perfect course for trying out domestic machine knitting.

This one day course will introduce you to the key functions of a knitting machine, and you will leave with the following skills:-

\-basic and e-wrap cast-on techniques

\-Turned up hem

\-Striping

\-Holding needles to create tuck textures

\-Punchcard knitting

\-Basic shaping techniques

\-Binding off

This is the perfect course if you are considering investing in your own knitting machine.

In the workshop I have Knitmaster and Brother standard gauge machines and a Brother Chunky, but If you have already bought a machine feel free to bring it along!

I will supply you with tea and coffee (or your choice of drink) but ask that you bring a packed lunch.

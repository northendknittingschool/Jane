This workshop is designed to teach you about the potential of your ribber!

By the end of the day you will understand what all the different knobs and 

dials do, and have a range of samples to take home.

We will start with the basic ribs often used for hems, such as 1x1 and 2x2 and

then move onto more decorative rib fabrics, which incorporate tucks and racking.

We will also knit double bed patterns working with punch cards.

I will supply you with tea & coffee (or your choice of drink) but ask that you bring a packed lunch.
